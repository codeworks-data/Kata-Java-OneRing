# Kata-Java-OneRing
This kata is inspired by the One Ring in The Lord Of The Ring.

## Instructions
You have to transform the existing `Ring` class to make it a singleton.

Singleton, in design pattern, is a class that can have only one instance.
Each time the initialization of the class is called the same instance must be returned.

# Rules
Create a singleton class.

## Code
In the `src/main` folder, you will find the class `Ring` to transform in a singleton.

## Test it
You can test your implementation by running the `src/test/RingTest` class.
